# GL Tech 2.1

GL Tech 2.1 is a 3D ray-casting engine designed in C# by Giuseppe Lanna that allows users to [build and render] interactive scenes. GL Tech 2 offers support to user-customizable [behavior and post-processing] systems and works entirely over the CPU.
Initially running over .Net Framework 4.7.2 and C# 7.2, was now migrated to .Net 5.0, which provides all C# 9.0 features.

## How to build

If you already have Visual Studio Community 2019 and .Net 5.0 installed, just open "src/GL Tech 2.1.sln" and press F5.
