\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Represents a behaviour script that can be attached to an element. Similar to Mono\+Behaviours on Unity3D. 

When a scene starts running, the engine is responsible for finding and executing Start() and Update() method properly. 

The Start() method, if any, will be executed once the scene is loaded. Update() method, otherwise, is called after every frame is rendered.
